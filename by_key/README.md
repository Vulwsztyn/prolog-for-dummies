# Quick sort, min, and max by key

- `easy` means that you can use to_key for each element individually
- `hard` means that you have to map elements to keys and sort by keys
    - my hard implementation assumes that you can use predicate like `map_to_pairs_with_keys` that maps list of elems to list of 2-element list where first elem is value second is key
