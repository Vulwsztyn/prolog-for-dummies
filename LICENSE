I explicitely forbid anyone working for Poznan University of Technology to use this code in didactic work, it is my wish that you don't even view it.
You are free to learn from it, and inform your students of the repository's existence, but any attempt to use the code as course material, or even showing the code to students to explain it is forbidden.

If you are a student and have seen the violation of the above rules, I ask you to report the misuse to me either via github or facebook.

Any other use of this code is allowed, I merely ask to be mentioned as the author, and that you star the repository.
