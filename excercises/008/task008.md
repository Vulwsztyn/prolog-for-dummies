Input:

- I - list of intervals - e.g. `[[-3, 5], [0, 7], [2, 10], [3, 8], [-2, 2]]`
- L - sorted list of integers - e.g. `[-4, -1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]`

Algorithm:

- for each element of I generate a flitered version o L consisting only of elements that are inside the interval (exclusively)
  - `[-3, 5] -> [-1, 2, 4]`
  - `[0, 7] -> [2, 4, 5]`
  - `[2, 10] -> [4, 5, 7, 8, 9]`
  - `[3, 8] -> [4, 5, 7] <- 8 is not here since exclusively`
  - `[-2, 2] -> [-1]`
- merge elements of I with elements of L from previous step - so that they are still sorted
  - `[-3, 5] -> [-1, 2, 4] -> [-3, -1, 2, 4, 5]`
  - `[0, 7] -> [2, 4, 5] -> [0, 2, 4, 5, 7]`
  - `[2, 10] -> [4, 5, 7, 8, 9] -> [2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
  - `[3, 8] -> [4, 5, 7] -> [3, 4, 5, 7, 8]`
  - `[-2, 2] -> [-1] -> [-2, -1, 2]`
- split lists from the previous step into intervals
  - `[-3, -1, 2, 4, 5] -> [[-3, -1], [-1, 2], [2, 4], [4, 5]]`
  - `[0, 2, 4, 5, 7] -> [[0, 2], [2, 4], [4, 5], [5, 7]]`
  - `[2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10] -> [[2, 4], [4, 5], [5, 7], [7, 8], [8, 9], [9, 10]]`
  - `[3, 4, 5, 7, 8] -> [[3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 7], [7, 8]]`
  - `[-2, -1, 2] -> [[-2, -1], [-1, 2]]`
- for each element of I find it's middle (average of its start and end)
  - `[-3, 5] -> 1`
  - `[0, 7] -> 3.5`
  - `[2, 10] -> 6`
  - `[3, 8] -> 5.5`
  - `[-2, 2] -> 0`
- for each middle and list of intervals from penultimate step find and interval in the list that contains the middle (right inclusively - e.g. 3 is in `[2, 3]`)
  - `[-3, 5] -> 1 and [[-3, -1], [-1, 2], [2, 4], [4, 5]] -> [2, 4]`
  - `[0, 7] -> 3.5 and [[0, 2], [2, 4], [4, 5], [5, 7]] -> [2, 4]`
  - `[2, 10] -> 6 and [[2, 4], [4, 5], [5, 7], [7, 8], [8, 9], [9, 10]] -> [5, 7]`
  - `[3, 8] -> 5.5 and [[3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 7], [7, 8]] -> [5, 7]`
  - `[-2, 2] -> 0 and [[-2, -1], [-1, 2]] -> [-1, 2]`
- for each interval from previous step find it's width (difference between end and start)
  - `[-3, 5] -> 1 and [[-3, -1], [-1, 2], [2, 4], [4, 5]] -> [2, 4] -> 2`
  - `[0, 7] -> 3.5 and [[0, 2], [2, 4], [4, 5], [5, 7]] -> [2, 4] -> 2`
  - `[2, 10] -> 6 and [[2, 4], [4, 5], [5, 7], [7, 8], [8, 9], [9, 10]] -> [5, 7] -> 2`
  - `[3, 8] -> 5.5 and [[3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 7], [7, 8]] -> [5, 7] -> 2`
  - `[-2, 2] -> 0 and [[-2, -1], [-1, 2]] -> [-1, 2] -> 3`
- for each element of I find it's width (difference between end and start)
  - `[-3, 5] -> 8`
  - `[0, 7] -> 7`
  - `[2, 10] -> 8`
  - `[3, 8] -> 5`
  - `[-2, 2] -> 4`
- for each interval from I absolute difference between widths from the previous and penultimate step is the key
  - `abs(width([-3, 5]) - width([2, 4])) -> 8 - 2 = 6`
  - `abs(width([0, 7]) - width([2, 4])) -> 7 - 2 = 6`
  - `abs(width([2, 10]) - width([5, 7])) -> 8 - 2 = 6`
  - `abs(width([3, 8]) - width([5, 7])) -> 5 - 2 = 3`
  - `abs(width([-2, 2]) - width([-1, 2])) -> 4 - 3 = 1`
- find max by key
