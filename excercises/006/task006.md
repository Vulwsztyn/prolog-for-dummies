Input:
- L - list of integers - e.g. `[623, 278, 4231, 739, 38]`

Algorithm:
- for each element of L create a list of all elements from L but this one (a complement)
    - `623 -> [278, 4231, 739, 38]`
    - `278 -> [623, 4231, 739, 38]`
    - `4231 -> [623, 278, 739, 38]`
    - `739 -> [623, 278, 4231, 38]`
    - `38 -> [623, 278, 4231, 739]`
- map each complement to list of digits in its elements:
    - `[278, 4231, 739, 38] -> [[2, 7, 8], [4, 2, 3, 1], [7, 3, 9], [3, 8]] -> [2, 7, 8, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 3, 9, 3, 8]`
    - `[623, 4231, 739, 38] -> [[6, 2, 3], [4, 2, 3, 1], [7, 3, 9], [3, 8]] -> [6, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 3, 9, 3, 8]`
    - `[623, 278, 739, 38] -> [[6, 2, 3], [2, 7, 8], [7, 3, 9], [3, 8]] -> [6, 2, 3, 2, 7, 8, 7, 3, 9, 3, 8]`
    - `[623, 278, 4231, 38] -> [[6, 2, 3], [2, 7, 8], [4, 2, 3, 1], [3, 8]] -> [6, 2, 3, 2, 7, 8, 4, 2, 3, 1, 3, 8]`
    - `[623, 278, 4231, 739] -> [[6, 2, 3], [2, 7, 8], [4, 2, 3, 1], [7, 3, 9]] -> [6, 2, 3, 2, 7, 8, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 3, 9]`
- for each original int find the number of occurences of its digits in resulting lists
    - `digits of 623 in [2, 7, 8, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 3, 9, 3, 8] -> [0, 2, 3]`
    - `digits of 278 in [6, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 3, 9, 3, 8] -> [2, 1, 1]`
    - `digits of 4231 in [6, 2, 3, 2, 7, 8, 7, 3, 9, 3, 8] -> [0, 2, 3, 0]`
    - `digits of 739 in [6, 2, 3, 2, 7, 8, 4, 2, 3, 1, 3, 8] -> [1, 3, 0]`
    - `digits of 38 in [6, 2, 3, 2, 7, 8, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 3, 9] -> [3, 1]`
- the average of the resulting lists is the key, find argument that gives minimal key
    - `digits of 623 in [2, 7, 8, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 3, 9, 3, 8] -> [0, 2, 3] -> 5/3`
    - `digits of 278 in [6, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 3, 9, 3, 8] -> [2, 1, 1] -> 4/3`
    - `digits of 4231 in [6, 2, 3, 2, 7, 8, 7, 3, 9, 3, 8] -> [0, 2, 3, 0] -> 5/4 <- this one` 
    - `digits of 739 in [6, 2, 3, 2, 7, 8, 4, 2, 3, 1, 3, 8] -> [1, 3, 0] -> 4/3`
    - `digits of 38 in [6, 2, 3, 2, 7, 8, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 3, 9] -> [3, 1] -> 2`
